## Why the Tests are Passing Despite Incorrect Implementation

The tests are passing because they don't cover all the necessary cases for a proper FizzBuzz implementation.

### The Issue

Looking at the code, there are two separate implementations:

1. `fizzBuzzSequence()` in Main.kt - This just returns an empty list, and only has two basic tests:
   - A test that verifies it can be called
   - A test that verifies it returns an empty list

2. `fizzBuzz(i: Int)` - This is a private method defined directly in the test class, which has several tests but is missing a critical test case.

### The Bug in the Implementation

The `fizzBuzz` implementation in the test class has a logical error:

```kotlin
private fun fizzBuzz(i: Int): String {
    if (i == -1) throw IllegalArgumentException("Parameter must be greater than 0")
    if (i % 5 == 0) return "buzz"
    if (i % 3 == 0) return "fizz"
    return i.toString()
}
```

According to the classic FizzBuzz rules, numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 should return "fizzbuzz". However, this implementation will only return "buzz" for such numbers because:

1. It checks divisibility by 5 first
2. If that condition is true, it returns "buzz" immediately
3. It never gets to check if the number is also divisible by 3

### Why Tests Pass Anyway

The tests pass because there's no test case for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (like 15, 30, etc.). The current tests only check:

- Regular numbers (1, 2)
- Numbers divisible by 3 only (3, 6, 9)
- Numbers divisible by 5 only (5, 10)
- Negative numbers (-1)

This is a classic example of why test coverage is important. The implementation is incorrect, but the tests don't catch the error because they don't test all the important cases.

To fix this, you should:
1. Add a test for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
2. Fix the implementation to check for this case first
