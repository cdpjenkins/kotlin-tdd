Use TDD:

If I ask you to write a failing test, please only write the testcase and do not make it pass.

If I ask you to fix a failing test, write code to pass the test as simply as possible and then stop. Don't implement
code for scenarios that are not covered by a failing test yet.

If I ask you to refactor the code, please refactor the code to improve code quality, without changing its behaviour.
 
Prefer outside-in testing to make the code easier to refactor later.

Match suggested refactorings to the size of the problem. Don't think too much. Don't overengineer!
